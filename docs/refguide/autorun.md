# Run side-effects with reactions

Reactions are an important concept to understand as it is where everything in MobX comes together.
The goal of reactions is to model side-effects that happen automatically.
Applications without side effects are meaningless; if an application doesn't cause a physical change in the world somewhere, it even doesn't have to run after all.
So the significance of reactions is to create consumers for your observable state and _automatically_ run side effects whenever something _relevant_ changes.

However, with that in mind, it is important to realize that the APIs discussed here should rarely be used.
Typically they are abstracted away in other libraries (like mobx-react) or abstractions that are specific to your application.

But, to grok MobX, let's take a look at how reactions can be created.
The simplest way is to use the [`autorun`](#autorun) utility.
Beyond that, there is also [`reaction`](#reaction) and [`when`](#when).

## Autorun

Usage:

-   `autorun(effect: (reaction) => void)`

The `autorun` function accepts one function that should run each time anything it observes changes.
It also runs once when you create the `autorun`. It only responds to changes in observable state -- so things you marked `observable` or `computed`.

### How tracking works

Autorun works by running `effect` in a _reactive context_; during the executing of the provided function MobX will keep track of all observable and computed values that are directly or indirectly _read_ by the effect.
Once the function finishes, MobX will collect and subscribe to all observables that were read and wait until any of them changes again.
Once any of these observables changes, the autorun will trigger again, repeating the entire process.
In a picture, the code-example below works like this:

![autorun](../assets/autorun.png)

### Example

```javascript
import { makeAutoObservable, autorun } from "mobx"

class Animal {
    name
    energyLevel

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
        this.energyLevel = 100
        makeAutoObservable(this)
    }

    reduceEnergy() {
        this.energyLevel -= 10
    }

    get isHungry() {
        return this.energyLevel < 50
    }
}

const giraffe = new Animal("Gary")

autorun(() => {
    console.log("Energy level:", giraffe.energyLevel)
})

autorun(() => {
    if (giraffe.isHungry) {
        console.log("Now I'm hungry!")
    } else {
        console.log("I'm not hungry!")
    }
})

console.log("Now let's change state!")
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    giraffe.reduceEnergy()
}
```

When you run this code, you get the following output:

```
Energy level: 100
I'm not hungry!
Now let's change state!
Energy level: 90
Energy level: 80
Energy level: 70
Energy level: 60
Energy level: 50
Energy level: 40
Now I'm hungry!
Energy level: 30
Energy level: 20
Energy level: 10
Energy level: 0
```

As you can see in the example, both `autorun` functions run once when they are initialized --
this is all you would see without the `for` loop. This accounts for the
first two lines of the output.

Once we run the `for` loop to change the `energyLevel` with the `reduceEnergy`
action we see a new log entry each time an `autorun` function observes a
change to its observable state:

-   For the "Energy level" function this is each time the observable property `energyLevel` changes, so 10 times.

-   For the "Now I'm hungry" function it's each time the `isHungry` computed
    changes; so only once.

## Reaction

Usage:

-   `reaction(() => value, (value, previousValue, reaction) => { sideEffect }, options?)`.

`reaction` is like `autorun` but gives more fine grained control on which observables will be tracked.
It takes two functions, the first one (the _data_ function) is tracked and returns data that is used as input for the second one, the _effect_ function.
It is important to notice that the side effect _only_ reacts to data that was _accessed_ in the data expression, which might be less than the data that is actually used in the effect.
The typical pattern is that you produce the things you need in your side effect
in the _data_ function, and in that way control more precisely when the effect triggers.

Unlike `autorun` the side effect won't be run directly when created, but only after the data expression returns a new value for the first time.

<details id="reaction-example">
  <summary>Example<a href="#reaction-example" class="tip-anchor"></a></summary>

In the example below, the reaction is only triggered once, when `isHungry` changes.
Changes to `giraffe.energyLevel`, which is used by the _effect_ function, do not cause the _effect_ function to be executed. If you wanted `reaction` to respond to this
as well, you would have to also access it in the _data_ function and return it.

```javascript
import { makeAutoObservable, reaction } from "mobx"

class Animal {
    name
    energyLevel

    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name
        this.energyLevel = 100
        makeAutoObservable(this)
    }

    reduceEnergy() {
        this.energyLevel -= 10
    }

    get isHungry() {
        return this.energyLevel < 50
    }
}

const giraffe = new Animal("Gary")

reaction(
    () => giraffe.isHungry,
    isHungry => {
        if (isHungry) {
            console.log("Now I'm hungry!")
        } else {
            console.log("I'm not hungry!")
        }
        console.log("Energy level:", giraffe.energyLevel)
    }
)

console.log("Now let's change state!")
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    giraffe.reduceEnergy()
}
```

The output of this example is:

```
Now let's change state!
Now I'm hungry!
Energy level: 40
```

## When

Usage:

-   `when(predicate: () => boolean, effect?: () => void, options?)`
-   `when(predicate: () => boolean, options?): Promise`

`when` observes and runs the given _predicate_ function until it returns `true`.
Once that happens, the given _effect_ function is executed and the autorunner is disposed.

The `when` function returns a disposer to allow you to cancel it manually, unless you don't pass in a second `effect` function, in which case it returns a `Promise`.

<details id="when-example">
  <summary>Example<a href="#when-example" class="tip-anchor"></a></summary>

This function is really useful to dispose or cancel stuff in a reactive way.
For example:

```javascript
import { when, makeAutoObservable } from "mobx"

class MyResource {
    constructor() {
        makeAutoObservable(this, { dispose: false })
        when(
            // once...
            () => !this.isVisible,
            // ... then
            () => this.dispose()
        )
    }

    get isVisible() {
        // indicate whether this item is visible
    }

    dispose() {
        // clean up some resources
    }
}
```

As soon as `isVisible` becomes `false`, the `dispose` method is called that
then does some cleanup for `MyResource`.

</details>

### await when(...)

If no `effect` function is provided, `when` returns a `Promise`. This combines nicely with `async / await` to let you wait for changes in observable state:

```javascript
async function() {
	await when(() => that.isVisible)
	// etc..
}
```

To cancel the `when` prematurely, it is possible to call `.cancel()` on the promise returned by `when`.

## Rules

There are a few rules that apply to any reactive context:

1. Affected reactions run by default immediately (synchronously) if an observable is changed. However, they won't run before the end of the current outermost (trans)action.
2. Autorun tracks only the observables that are read during the synchronous execution of the provided function, but it won't track anything that happens asynchronously.
3. Autorun won't track observables that are read by an action invoked by the autorun, as actions are always _untracked_.

For a more examples on what precisely MobX will and won't react to, see [what does MobX react to](../best/what-does-mobx-react-to.md).
For a detailed technical breakdown on how tracking works, read [Becoming fully reactive: an in-depth explanation of MobX](https://hackernoon.com/becoming-fully-reactive-an-in-depth-explanation-of-mobservable-55995262a254)

## Always dispose reactions

The functions passed to `autorun`, `reaction`, `when` are only garbage collected if all objects they observe are garbage collected themselves; in principle they keep waiting forever for new changes to happen in the observables they use.
To be able to stop them from waiting until forever has passed, they all return a disposer function that can be used to stop them and unsubscribe from any observables used.

```javascript
const counter = observable({ count: 0 })
// sets up the autorun, prints 0
const disposer = autorun(() => {
    console.log(counter.count)
})
// prints 1
counter.count++

// stops the autorun
disposer()
// won't print
counter.count++
```

We strongly recommend to always use the disposer function that is returned from these functions as soon as their side effect is no longer needed.
Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks.

The `reaction` argument that is passed as second argument to the effect functions of `reaction` and `autorun` can be used to prematurely clean up the reaction as well by calling `reaction.dispose()`.

<details id="mem-leak-example"><summary>Memory leak example<a href="#mem-leak-example" class="tip-anchor"></a></summary>

```javascript
class Vat {
    value = 1.2

    constructor() {
        makeAutoObservable(this)
    }
}

const vat = new Vat()

class OrderLine {
    price = 10
    amount = 1
    constructor() {
        makeAutoObservable(this)

        // this autorun will be GC-ed together with the current orderline instance
        // as it only uses observables from `this`. It's not strictly necessary
        // to dispose of it once an OrderLine instance is deleted.
        this.disposer1 = autorun(() => {
            doSomethingWith(this.price * this.amount)
        })
        // this autorun won't be GC-ed together with the current orderline instance
        // since vat keeps a reference to notify this autorun, which in turn keeps
        // 'this' in scope
        this.disposer2 = autorun(() => {
            doSomethingWith(this.price * this.amount * vat.value)
        })
    }

    dispose() {
        // So, to avoid subtle memory issues, always call the
        // disposers when the reaction is no longer needed
        this.disposer1()
        this.disposer2()
    }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Reaction options

The `options` argument as shown above can be passed to further fine tune the behavior of `autorun` / `reaction` / `when`:

-   `name`: Debug name (string) that is used as name for this reaction in for example [`spy`](../best/debugging-mobx.md#spy) events.
-   `fireImmediately` (reaction): Boolean that indicates that the _effect_ function should immediately be triggered after the first run of the _data_ function. `false` by default.
-   `delay` (reaction, autorun): Number in milliseconds that can be used to throttle the effect function. If zero (the default), no throttling happens.
-   `timeout` (when): Set a limited amount of time that `when` will wait. If the deadline passes, `when` will reject / throw.
-   `onError`: By default any exception thrown inside a reaction will be logged but not further thrown. This is to make sure that an exception in one reaction does not prevent the scheduled execution of other, possibly unrelated, reactions. This also allows reactions to recover from exceptions; throwing an exception does not break the tracking done by MobX, so as subsequent run of a reaction might complete normally again if the cause for the exception is removed. This option allows overriding that behavior. It is possible to set a global error handler or to disable catching errors completely using [configure](configure.md).
-   `scheduler` (autorun, reaction): Set a custom scheduler to determine how re-running the autorun function should be scheduled. It takes a function that should be invoked at some point in the future, for example: `{ scheduler: run => { setTimeout(run, 1000) }}`
-   `equals`: (reaction) `comparer.default` by default. If specified, this comparer function is used to compare the previous and next values produced by the _data_ function. The _effect_ function is only invoked if this function returns false. See [built-in-comparers](computed.html#built-in-comparers) for some default available options.

## Use reactions sparingly!

As said, typically you won't create reactions very often.
It might very well be that your application doesn't use any of those APIs directly, and the only way reactions are construction is indirectly through for example `observer` from the mobx-react bindings.

Before you set up a reaction, it is good to check if it complies to the following principles first:

1. **Only use Reactions if there is no direct relation between cause and effect**: If a side effect should happen in response to a very limited set of events / actions, it will often be clearer to directly trigger the effect from those specific actions. For example, if pressing a form submit button should lead to a network request to be posted, it is clearer to trigger this effect directly in response of the `onClick` event, rather than indirectly through a reaction. In contrast, if any change you make to the form state should automatically end up in local storage, then a reaction can be very useful, so that you don't have to trigger this effect from every individual `onChange` event.
1. **Reactions shouldn't update other observables**: Is the reaction going to modify some observables? If the answer is yes, typically the observable you want to update should be expressing using a [`computed`](computed.md) value instead. For example, if a collection of todos is altered, don't use a reaction to compute the amount of `remainingTodos`, but express `remainingTodos` as a computed value. That will lead to much clearer and easier to debug code. Reactions should not compute new data but only cause effects. Put differently, side effects are in principle not observable from your application code itself but only affect the 'outside world'.
1. **Reactions should be independent**: Does your code rely on some other reaction to have run first? If that is the case, you probably
   either violated the first rule, or the new reaction you are about to create should be merged into the one it is depending upon. MobX doesn't guarantee the order in which reactions will be run.

There are real-life scenarios that don't fit in above principles. That is why they are _principles_, not _laws_.
But, the exceptions are rare so only violate them as a last resort.
